# Space-Grade-Power-Distribution-PCB

This is a space-grade PCB designed to verify the power distribution layout and the functionality of integrated circuits (ICs) for the SAR mission. The design aims to ensure reliable power management before it is integrated into the main processor PCB. Once the power distribution passes testing, it will be used in the final design for the processor PCB.
